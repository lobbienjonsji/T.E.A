# The Exordian Avenger
T.E.A is short for "The Exordian Avenger" and is a mod for the game Slay the Spire.
It is currently work in progress and is planned to add a louse-like character that has low max hp and damage scaling,
but excellent defence, however at a cost of temporary hp loss (heals back up at the end of combat). Other mechanics will include 
taunts, powerful cards that come at the cost of buffing the enemy, silencing, which prevents buffs like artifact prevents debuffs and recurrent cards, that add copies of themselves to the players hand after a certain number of turns.
